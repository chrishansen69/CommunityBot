The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.","A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators.

This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.","Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?","The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.","As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.","Failure is not an option.","NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.","There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations.
